# Awesome Licenses

This repo collects common licenses (MIT, Apache, GPL, BSD, etc.) so you can quickly copy, paste, and license your project.

1. MIT License:
   This license is popular for its simplicity, allowing users to do almost anything with the code as long as the original license text and copyright notice are included.

2. Apache License 2.0:
   This license is favored by projects with corporate contributors because it provides explicit patent grants and protections alongside its permissive terms.

3. BSD Licenses:
   Similar to MIT, the BSD licenses (2-clause and 3-clause) are permissive but include specific attribution requirements.

4. GNU General Public License (GPL):
   The GPL is a copyleft license that requires derivative works to be released under the same GPL license, ensuring that the software and its improvements remain open-source.

5. Good Luck With That Public License (GLWTPL):
   This license essentially disclaims all responsibility, allowing users to do whatever they want with the code while making it clear that the original authors provide no warranty, support, or guarantees—you're on your own.
