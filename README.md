# Awesome Licenses

This repo collects common licenses (MIT, Apache, GPL, BSD, etc.) so you can quickly copy, paste, and license your project.

1. [MIT License](1.MIT):
   This license is popular for its simplicity, allowing users to do almost anything with the code as long as the original license text and copyright notice are included.

2. [Apache License 2.0](2.APACHEv2):
   This license is favored by projects with corporate contributors because it provides explicit patent grants and protections alongside its permissive terms.

3. BSD Licenses:
   Similar to MIT, the BSD licenses (2-clause and 3-clause) are permissive but include specific attribution requirements.

4. [GNU General Public License (GPL)](4.gpl-3.0):
   The GPL is a copyleft license that requires derivative works to be released under the same GPL license, ensuring that the software and its improvements remain open-source.

5. [Good Luck With That Public License (GLWTPL)](5.GLWTPL):
   This license essentially disclaims all responsibility, allowing users to do whatever they want with the code while making it clear that the original authors provide no warranty, support, or guaranteesâ€”you're on your own.
